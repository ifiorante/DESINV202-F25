/*
  Blink

  Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. 
  On the UNO it is attached to digital pin 13

  This example code is modified from.

*/

int led = 12;  // define a variable to hold the pin number of the internal LED

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
  //initialize serial communications at 9600 baud rate
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  //Serial.println("Hello, world!");
  Serial.println("Hello, world!"); //send 'Hello, world!' over the serial port
  digitalWrite(led, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);               // wait for a second   
  digitalWrite(led, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);               // wait for a second
}
